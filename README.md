This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

This project was solo developed by Jason Lee. It utilizes Next.js, a React framework, to create full-stack web features.

## Technologies

Overall, only a few applications were used, but the coding aspect was very meticuluous. 
    - C++ (Tailwind CSS Static)
    - JavaScript (ReactJS)
    - Hostinger (Cloud WebHosting)
    - Next.js (Nodejs)

## Goals

The key goal of this project was to implement Framer Motion into the website. The animations on the website are proof of Framer Motion and in this project I learned
how to code my own animations to call upon.
